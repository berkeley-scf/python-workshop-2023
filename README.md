# python-workshop-2023
Materials for Python short course for incoming Statistics grad students.

## Logistics

The workshop content is in Markdown in python.md with a rendered HTML version in python.html and an Jupyter notebook version in python.ipynb. The mini-project material is in project.md/project.html/project.ipynb.

To download the materials on your computer, you have two options:

 - clone this Github repository (if you are familiar with Git)
 - download [this zip file](https://github.com/berkeley-scf/python-workshop-2023/archive/gh-pages.zip)

Schedule:

 - Introduction to Python: 9 am - 1:30 pm Wednesday Aug. 16 in Evans 330 (or a nearby room)
 - Project work: 9 am - 1:30 pm Thursday Aug. 17 in Evans 330 (or a nearby room)

We may be able to provide a few snacks, but given the somewhat late end time, feel free to bring your own and some lunch if you expect to be hungry.

## Instructions for accessing Python

The only, but important, preparation in advance of the bootcamp is to make sure you have access to Python, with key packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, statsmodels) that we'll use during the bootcamp.

Whether you run Python (or IPython) through the command line or via a Jupyter Notebook doesn't matter.

Below are three options for having access to Python. Please make sure at least one of these works for you before you arrive at the short course. The last two options require a computing account with the department through the Statistical Computing Facility, which you request here:
https://scf.berkeley.edu/account

 1) Download and install [Anaconda (Python 3.11 distribution)](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) on your laptop. Click "Download" and then click 64-bit "Graphical Installer" for your current operating system.

 2) Use the UC Berkeley DataHub to access Python via Jupyter notebooks. [TBD]
 
 3) SSH to any SCF Linux machine and run Python from the command line. [TBD]

 4) Login to the [SCF JupyterHub](https://jupyter.stat.berkeley.edu)
 (using your SCF username and password) to access a Jupyter IPython notebook. Further instructions are [here](https://rawgit.com/berkeley-scf/python-bootcamp-2018/master/jupyter_instructions.html). [TBD]
 
If you have any questions about the Statistical Computing Facility or getting an account please email trouble@stat.berkeley.edu. If you have questions about the workshop please don't hesitate to email me.
